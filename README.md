# Daily_Scrum_Timer
Timer for Daily Scrum 

Consists of two seven segment Displays:

One for displaying the time left for the meeting and one single seven segment display displaying the remaining talk time of the member

When the button on the right is pressed the meeting timer starts. Then you can start the talk timer by pressing the button on the left. If 
the member has finished with talking the button on the left must be pressed to set back the three minutes.
If the meeting time is over there is a buzzer-signal and the seven segment display displays "ENDE". If the talk time is over there is a buzzer-signal, too.
The button in the middle is for resetting both timers.
